# Learn Vim Game - Development Log

## Session Date: 2025-10-01

### Session 3 - Complete Feature Implementation & Dark Theme Redesign ✅

#### Bug Fixes - Lessons 10 & 11 ✅

**Lesson 10 Fix:**
- Fixed incorrect target position (was col: 27, should be col: 25)
- Added `e` and `$` to allowed commands for easier navigation
- Updated hints to guide users to the X

**Lesson 11 Fix:**
**Problem 1:** Lesson completed after just replacing X, before changing "bad" to "good"
**Solution:** Added `targetState` to require both replacements to complete

**Problem 2:** `c` and `cw` commands not working
**Solution:**
- Added `c` as a pending command handler in keyboard event listener
- Added multi-character command support for `cw`
- Now `c` waits for `w` to execute `cw` (change word)

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/data/lessons.js`
  - Lesson 10: Fixed target position, added navigation commands
  - Lesson 11: Added targetState, expanded allowed commands
- `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js`
  - Updated replace task completion to check targetState first
- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
  - Added `c` pending command handler
  - Added `cw` multi-character command support

  - Added `cw` command (change word - deletes word and enters insert mode)
  - Added `m{a-z}` command (set mark)
  - Added `'{a-z}` command (jump to mark)
  - Added keyboard handlers for all new commands

**Features:**
- **Lesson 10:** `{` and `}` navigate between paragraphs
- **Lesson 11:**
  - `r` - Replace single character under cursor
  - `R` - Enter replace mode (overwrites characters)
  - `cw` - Change word (delete and insert)

#### Complete UI Redesign - Dark Theme with Sharp Corners ✅
**Problem:**
Previous design used gradients, glassmorphism effects, and rounded corners. User requested a dark theme with sharp corners.

**Solution:**
Complete CSS overhaul to GitHub-inspired dark theme with sharp edges.

**Design Choices:**
- **Color Palette:** GitHub dark theme colors
  - Background: `#0d1117` (dark base)
  - Cards/Containers: `#161b22` (slightly lighter)
  - Borders: `#30363d` (subtle gray)
  - Primary accent: `#58a6ff` (blue)
  - Success: `#3fb950` (green)
  - Warning: `#d29922` (yellow)
  - Danger: `#da3633` (red)
  - Text: `#e6edf3` (light gray)
  - Muted text: `#8b949e` (medium gray)

- **Sharp Corners:** Removed all `border-radius` - everything is square
- **No Glassmorphism:** Removed `backdrop-filter: blur()` and transparency effects
- **Solid Borders:** Replaced gradient borders with solid 1px borders
- **Minimal Shadows:** Removed elaborate box-shadows
- **Flat Buttons:** No gradients, solid colors with simple hover states

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/index.css` - Global styles, dark background
- `client/src/components/VimSimulator.css` - Editor dark theme
- `client/src/components/LessonList.css` - Lesson cards redesign
- `client/src/components/Dashboard.css` - Dashboard header/nav redesign
- `client/src/components/Auth.css` - Login/signup forms
- `client/src/components/Achievements.css` - Achievement cards
- `client/src/components/DebugPanel.css` - Debug panel styling

**Results:**
- Clean, professional GitHub-style dark theme
- Sharp, modern aesthetic with no rounded corners
- Consistent color scheme across all components
- Improved readability with proper contrast
- Reduced bundle size (10.96 kB CSS vs 11.67 kB before)

#### Copy/Paste Functionality Implementation (Lesson 9) - COMPLETE ✅
**Problem:**
Lesson 9 includes yank/paste commands (`y`, `yy`, `yw`, `p`, `P`) in allowed commands, but there was no implementation. Commands had no effect.

**Solution:**
Implemented full yank (copy) and paste functionality with register management.

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/hooks/useVimState.js`
  - Added `register` state to store copied text (clipboard)
  - Added `registerType` to track whether copied content is 'line' or 'char'
  - Added `SET_REGISTER` action to update clipboard

- `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js`
  - Added `yankText()` function for copying text
    - `yy` - Yank entire line
    - `yw` - Yank word from cursor position
    - `y` - Yank visual selection (in visual mode)
  - Added `pasteText()` function for pasting
    - `p` - Paste after cursor/line
    - `P` - Paste before cursor/line

    - Detects when any line has been duplicated (successful yank+paste)

- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
  - Added yank command handlers (y, yy, yw)
  - Added paste command handlers (p, P)
  - Multi-character command support (yy, yw)
  - Visual mode yank support
  - Shows feedback messages ("Yanked: ...", "Pasted...")
  - Saves state before paste for undo

**Features:**
- `yy` - Yank (copy) entire line
- `yw` - Yank word from cursor
- `y` - Yank visual selection (in visual mode)
- `p` - Paste after cursor (char mode) or below line (line mode)
- `P` - Paste before cursor (char mode) or above line (line mode)
- Register preserves content across multiple operations
- Works with undo/redo
- Visual feedback shows what was yanked

**Completion Requirement:**
- Lesson 9 completes when any line is duplicated (detected by checking for duplicate lines)

### Session 3 - Search and Undo/Redo Implementation ✅

#### Search Functionality Implementation (Lesson 7) - COMPLETE ✅
**Problem:**
Lesson 7 includes search commands (`/`, `?`, `n`, `N`) in allowed commands, but there was no implementation. Pressing `/` or other search keys had no effect.

**Solution:**
Implemented full search functionality with the following features:

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/hooks/useVimState.js`
  - Added search state: `searchTerm`, `searchMatches`, `currentMatchIndex`
  - Added actions: `ENTER_SEARCH_MODE`, `SET_SEARCH_TERM`, `SET_SEARCH_MATCHES`, `NEXT_MATCH`, `PREV_MATCH`

- `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js`
  - Added `findMatches()` function for searching text
  - Supports case-insensitive search
  - Handles forward/backward search with wrapping

- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
  - Added search mode keyboard handler (accepts text input)
  - `/` - Enter forward search mode
  - `?` - Enter backward search mode
  - `Enter` - Execute search and jump to first match
  - `n` - Jump to next match
  - `N` - Jump to previous match
  - `Escape` - Exit search mode
  - Shows match counter (e.g., "Match 2 of 5")

- `client/src/data/lessons.js`
  - Added `?` to lesson 7 allowed commands

**Features:**
- Search prompt displays in footer (just like Vim: `/treasure`)
- Search mode displays in header
- Match counter feedback
- Wrapping search (cycles through all matches)

---

#### Undo/Redo Functionality Implementation (Lesson 8) - COMPLETE ✅
**Problem:**
Lesson 8 includes undo (`u`) and redo (`Ctrl+r`) in allowed commands, but there was no implementation. Commands were mapped but not functional.

**Solution:**
Implemented full undo/redo functionality with state stack management.

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/hooks/useVimState.js`
  - Added `undoStack` and `redoStack` to state
  - Added actions: `SAVE_STATE_FOR_UNDO`, `UNDO`, `REDO`
  - Undo stack saves text and cursor position
  - Redo stack cleared on new actions (standard undo behavior)

- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
  - Added `u` command handler for undo
  - Added `Ctrl+r` keyboard handler for redo
  - Automatically saves state before delete operations
  - Shows "Undo" / "Redo" feedback messages

**Features:**
- `u` - Undo last change
- `Ctrl+r` - Redo undone change
- Stack-based undo/redo (multiple levels)
- Preserves cursor position
- Works with all delete operations (x, dd, dw, d$, visual mode delete)

**Completion Requirement:**
- Added `task: "undo"` to lesson 8
- Lesson completes when text returns to initial state after undo
- Updated instructions and hints to guide user through the undo process

**Bug Fix - Auto-completion Issue:**
**Problem:** Lesson 8 was completing immediately on load because text was already in initial state.

**Solution:**
- Added `undoPerformed` state flag in VimSimulatorRefactored
- Updated `checkTaskCompletion()` to require `undoPerformed === true` for undo tasks
- Lesson now only completes when:
  1. User performs an undo operation (`u` pressed)
  2. Text matches initial state
  3. Both conditions must be true

### Session 2 - Visual Mode Delete Bug Fixes

#### Visual Mode Delete Command Recognition - CRITICAL BUG FIX ✅
**Problem:**
When in visual mode with text selected, pressing 'd' was not deleting the selection. The 'd' key wasn't even being registered as a command in the debugger.

**Root Cause:**
The keyboard handler was treating 'd' as the start of a multi-character command (like 'dd', 'dw', 'd$') in ALL modes, including visual mode. It was setting 'd' as a pending command and waiting for a second key, instead of immediately executing the delete.

**Solution:**
Modified `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx` (lines 175-186) to check the current mode:
- **Visual mode**: 'd' immediately executes and deletes the selection
- **Normal mode**: 'd' sets pending command and waits for second key

**Testing:**
Sequence `w,w,w,v,w,d` on Lesson 6 now works perfectly! ✓

---

#### Visual Mode Delete Range Fix ✅
**Problem:**
The deletion range was including one extra character (the first character of the next word).

**Solution:**
Updated `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js` (line 116):
- Changed from `slice(end + 1)` to `slice(end)`
- Deletion is now exclusive of the cursor position (doesn't include the character the cursor lands on)

---

#### Lesson Title Display Cleanup ✅
**Action:**
Removed lesson title/number from VimHeader - they belong only in LessonList cards.

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/VimHeader.jsx`
- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
- `client/src/components/VimSimulator.css`

---

### Session 1 - Initial Improvements

#### Recent Changes and Improvements

#### 1. Lesson Name Indicator
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `client/src/components/VimHeader.jsx` to display the current lesson title
- Updated `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx` to pass `lesson.title` prop to VimHeader
- Added CSS styling in `client/src/components/VimSimulator.css` for the lesson title display
  - Centered in header between mode indicator and stats
  - Blue color (#569cd6) for visibility

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/VimHeader.jsx`
- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
- `client/src/components/VimSimulator.css`

---

#### 2. Visual Mode Word Selection Bug Fix
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:**
When pressing 'w' in visual mode on the word "DELETE", it was selecting extra characters (the space and first char of next word).

**Solution:**
- Rewrote the 'w' (word forward) command logic in `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js` (lines 22-42)
- New implementation:
  1. Skips all characters in the current word (non-whitespace)
  2. Skips all whitespace after the word
  3. Lands on the first character of the next word
  4. Properly handles end-of-line cases

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js`

---

#### 3. Visual Mode Delete Functionality Fix
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:**
Delete functionality wasn't working correctly in visual mode after word selection.

**Solution:**
- Updated visual mode delete logic in `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js` (lines 99-112)
- Added cursor position validation to ensure cursor doesn't exceed line length after deletion
- Formula: `newCursorPos.col = Math.min(start, Math.max(0, newLine.length - 1))`

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/utils/vimCommands.js`

---

#### 4. Debug Panel Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Feature:**
Created a comprehensive debugging tool to help visualize errors and state during development.

**Components Created:**
- `client/src/components/DebugPanel.jsx` - Main debug panel component
- `client/src/components/DebugPanel.css` - Styling for debug panel

**Features:**
- **Floating Toggle Button:** Bottom-right corner button to open/close debug panel
- **Three Tabs:**
  1. **State Tab:** Shows real-time Vim state (mode, cursor position, text lines, visual start, pending commands, mistakes)
  2. **Commands Tab:** Displays full command history with indexed list
  3. **Errors Tab:** Logs all errors with timestamps (especially disallowed commands)
- **Auto-logging:** Automatically logs when user tries disallowed commands
- **Dark Theme:** Consistent with the Vim simulator's dark theme

**Integration:**
- Added to `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`
- Error logging function `logError()` added to capture and timestamp errors
- State is passed to debug panel in real-time

**Files Created:**
- `client/src/components/DebugPanel.jsx`
- `client/src/components/DebugPanel.css`

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/VimSimulatorRefactored.jsx`

### Known Issues / Future Improvements

#### Potential Issues to Monitor:
1. **Multi-line visual selection:** Current delete only works on single-line selections
2. **Word movement edge cases:** May need testing with punctuation and special characters
3. **Command validation:** Some advanced commands may not be fully implemented yet

#### Suggested Future Features:
1. Export debug logs to file for sharing
2. Visual mode support for multi-line selections
3. More comprehensive error messages in debug panel
4. Add search functionality (/, ?, n, N) - currently defined in lessons but may need implementation check
5. Undo/redo functionality (u, Ctrl+r) - currently in lesson 8 but implementation status unclear
6. Copy/paste functionality (y, p, P) - currently in lesson 9

---

### Testing Recommendations

**To Test the New Features:**
1. Start a lesson and observe the lesson title in the header
2. Try lesson 6 (Visual Mode) to test the word selection fix:
   - Navigate to the word "DELETE"
   - Press 'v' to enter visual mode
   - Press 'w' to select the word (should not over-select)
   - Press 'd' to delete (should work correctly now)
3. Click the "🐛 Debug" button in bottom-right to open debug panel
4. Try using disallowed commands to see them logged in the Errors tab
5. Check the Commands tab to see your command history
6. Check the State tab to inspect current Vim state

---

### Development Environment

**Framework:** React (Vite)
**Styling:** CSS Modules / Plain CSS
**State Management:** Custom useVimState hook with reducer pattern
**Backend:** Express.js with SQLite database

---

## Next Steps / TODO

- [ ] Test all 12 lessons to ensure fixes work across all scenarios
- [ ] Verify search commands implementation (lesson 7)
- [ ] Verify undo/redo implementation (lesson 8)
- [ ] Verify copy/paste implementation (lesson 9)
- [ ] Consider adding debug log export functionality
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes (debug panel positioning)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut to toggle debug panel (e.g., Ctrl+D)

---

## Notes

- All changes maintain the existing dark theme aesthetic
- Debug panel is non-intrusive and can be hidden when not needed
- Error tracking helps identify command issues during lesson development
- Word movement logic now more closely matches actual Vim behavior
